ruby-sdbm (1.0.0-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Revert "debian/rules: drop dependencies on ruby". Rebuilding against the
    newer ruby-defaults will get the dependencies right again.

ruby-sdbm (1.0.0-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/rules: drop dependencies on ruby.
    As librubyX.Y is supposed to depend on this package, it must be
    cross-installable in a way that does not remove the native ruby
    interpreter for crossbuilding Ruby extensions to be actually possible.

ruby-sdbm (1.0.0-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Mark as Multi-Arch: same, as we want librubyX.Y do depend on this package
  * Bump Standards-Version to 4.6.1; no changes needed

ruby-sdbm (1.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium
